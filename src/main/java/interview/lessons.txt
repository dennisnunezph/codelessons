abstract;base class whose methods defined as abstract needs to be implemented or redefined as abstract
Abstraction;
Access Modifier
ArrayList
Behavioural Design Pattern
BigO notation;O(N) -single iteration, O(N ^ 2) -double iteration, O(2N) double growth per additional input.O(log N) - logarithms binary search  
Builder Pattern;a creational design patter used to build an object with a lot of optional parameters
char;
classloader;primordial, extn libraries, classpath
concurrency
Comparator;compare(Object obj1, Object obj2)
CompareTo;a method that needs to be implemented in Comparable
Connection Pooling;Commons DBCP vs c3PO
Coupling;measure of how much a class is dependent on another class
data types;be careful, bears shouldn't ingest large fluffy dogs - boolean, char,byte, short, int, long,float,double
Defensive Copy
Deadlock;when a thread cannot obtain a lock of an object since other thread has been using it or execution is inside synchronized state
Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy
Design Patters;Creational, Behavioral and Structural
Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList;ArrayList-random access Linked List-walk through each nodes
Difference between and Stack and a Queue; Stack-FILO Queue - FIFO
DOM vs SAX
Equals - must override hasCode too
Encapsulation;information hiding via getters and setters
Enum;
Error;OutOfMemoryError
Exception
final vs finally; final-variable declaration for immutability.cannot be subclassess finally - guaranteed execution in block in try catch.  finalize - cleanup method before garbase collection 
float
Flyweight pattern;structural-decrease object count
Foreign Key
Generics;provides compile-time safety for methods which accepts subtypes
HashMap-implementation of Map
Heap;where objects in Java are created
Hibernate
How do you count the elements in a linked list; private int countRec()
Http Get;1024 limit
Immutable Class;final Class, final private variables, no setter, defensive copies of Dates,List
Index
Inner Classes
Inner Join vs Outer Join
int
interface
Iterator;public Iterator<String> iterator() { return new LinkedListIterator(); }\n private class LinkedListIterator implements Iterator<String> {
Is float amt = 10.3 corrrect?;No. float amt = 10.3f;
java collections
JPA;specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between entity and relational database tables
Lazy Loading;design pattern in java where initialization are deferred until the point at which it is needed.
LinkedList-how do you count the elements?
MVC;Model View Controller

OOP;Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
Pass by Value or Pass by Reference;Java is Pass by Value
PECS;Producer Extends Consumer Super
PermGen;Permanent Generation-objects which survided Young Gen, Tenured Gen. Where java classes are stored
Polymorphism;Allows the supertypes and its subtype to be accepted in a method without changing the code
Race Condition;shared data is modified by multiple threads
REST;GET PUT DELETE
Runtime Exception;NPE, ArithmeticException,IllegalArgumentException, NoSuchMethodException, IndexOutOfBoundsException
Primary Key - only one in each table
Servlet;java class which allows servers to communicate with clients by means of request response model
Session Tracking;User Login, URL Rewriting, Hidden Forms, Cookies and Sessions
Session Replication;only for session.setAttributes
Set
Singleton;lazy instantations and ensure only one instance is created
SOAP;Simple Object Access Protocol. A data interchange format
SOLID;Single Responsibility Principle\n Open For Modification close for extension \n Liskov Substitution Principle \n Interface Segregation \n Dependency Inversion Principle
Sorting;
spring framework
Stack;where objects in parameters and inside parameters live
static classes
static initializers
Sticky Session;user is tied to a specific server
SQL Aggregates;AVG, SUM, MIN, MAXa
Thread Contention;one thread is waiting for a lock/object that is currently being held by another thread
Thread State; New, Runnable, Blocked, Waiting, Timed_Waiting, Terminating
Throwable;super class of all errors and exception. Only subclasses of throwable can be used in throws. throwable(exception,error)
Time;DateTime, JodaDateTime
Url Rewriting;adding extra information to a URL
Unit Testing
Volatile
Weak Reference
Why is notify, notifyAll part of an Object;Locks are per Object so only the Object can invoke Notify and NotifyAll
WSDL-port, service,
